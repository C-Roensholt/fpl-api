# FPL API

This is a simple API for the Fantasy Premier League game. It scrapes the official FPL site to retrieve data and present it in JSON format.

## Documentation

The API design is inspired by the [Fantasy Premier League API Endpoints: A Detailed Guide](https://medium.com/@frenzelts/fantasy-premier-league-api-endpoints-a-detailed-guide-acbd5598eb19) by [Frenzel Timothy](https://medium.com/@frenzelts?source=post_page-----acbd5598eb19--------------------------------).
The guide shows all endpoint that are implemented in this API wrapper.
